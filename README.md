# Mask-RCNN-Detectron2-FOR-Miaze-Stomata-Segmentation and Cell Profiler Pipeline to Perform parameter measurements in CellProfiller

### Description

Stomata are epidermal pores that facilitate plant gas exchange. Grasses have fast stomatal movements, which might be related to the plant's resistance to drought. The fast grass stomata are likely due to their dumbbell‚Äêshaped guard cells and lateral subsidiary cells. Our previous work showed that subsidiary cells are necessary for the stomata function in corn. In this project, we want to explore what anatomy of the guard and subsidiary cells is important for stomatal efficiency.

Train on confocal images of the leaf epidermis to autometically segment the subsidiary cells and guard cells of maize inbred lines and measure the pixel areas, cell length and width of guard cells and subsidiary cells.
